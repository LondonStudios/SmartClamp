# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

# SmartClamp - London Studios
**SmartClamp** is a **FiveM** resource allowing you to clamp vehicles and place a "Vehicle Seized" sticker to display the vehicle is uninsured. Once clamped, the vehicle will not be able to move!
All actions can be carried out by a simple menu, opened with /clamp.

Included is a yellow triangle clamp model and a British police uninsured sticker model.

The **LSPDFR** version will be releasing soon!

**Please note:** We've tried our best with the sticker, however it will **not** work on all vehicles, some will look out of place due to different shapes and sizes. However, we think it is good as it is now.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!
