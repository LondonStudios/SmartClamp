# SmartClamp - London Studios
**SmartClamp** is a **FiveM** resource allowing you to clamp vehicles and place a "Vehicle Seized" sticker to display the vehicle is uninsured. Once clamped, the vehicle will not be able to move!
All actions can be carried out by a simple menu, opened with /clamp.

Included is a yellow triangle clamp model and a British police uninsured sticker model.

The **LSPDFR** version will be releasing soon!

**Please note:** We've tried our best with the sticker, however it will **not** work on all vehicles, some will look out of place due to different shapes and sizes. However, we think it is good as it is now.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!
